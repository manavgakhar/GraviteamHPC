# High Performance Computing Project

Objective - Our goal is to increase the performance of the code used for the calculation of N-Body simulation. Through our experiments, we aim to identify the performance improvements that are shown by adopting parallelization. 

Optimized Gravitational 3-D N body simulation code in C++, along with 2-D and 3-D simulations in Python

To run the C++ simulations, use commands - 
-  g++ -fopenmp nbody.cpp -o run_file
-   ./run_file
